            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-gray-700">
                This document provides a set of interview questions for our Data Science Faculty candidates. The questions are designed to help you assess their understanding of core data science concepts and, more importantly, their ability to explain these concepts clearly and simply, even to someone without a technical background.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
                Each question introduces a key data science term and then uses a simple analogy to make it relatable. Your role is to listen for how they elaborate on the analogy and how effectively they break down the technical details.
